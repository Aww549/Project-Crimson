# Follow-up Analysis: "New Player" Persona

**1. Simulation Data & Assumptions:**
*   A "New Player" is defined as having no upgrades, resulting in **10 bullet damage** and a fire rate of **2 shots per second** (20 DPS).
*   The **zombie health cap** is set to **200**. My calculations show that a normal zombie's health would only naturally exceed this cap at **Wave 94**.
*   The **"Breather Wave"** rule guarantees a Loot Wave after 3 consecutive "tough" (non-Loot) waves.

**2. Key Question & Answer:**
*   **Question:** *Based on the new simulation, do the "Breather Wave" and health cap successfully smooth out the difficulty curve and prevent the Wave 9 "hard wall"?*
*   **Answer:** **Yes, primarily due to the "Breather Wave" rule.**
    *   The previous "hard wall" was not just about zombie health, but resource starvation from an unlucky streak of difficult waves. A player could face Gauntlet and Runner waves repeatedly, leaving them with few survivors or shields to handle the increasing zombie density around Wave 9.
    *   The new "Breather Wave" logic makes such a streak impossible. After three tough waves (e.g., Waves 6, 7, and 8), Wave 9 is now **guaranteed to be a Loot Wave**. This provides a critical, predictable respite for the player to gather resources, effectively dismantling the "hard wall."
    *   The health cap works as intended for long-term balance but does not impact the early-game difficulty curve, as it only takes effect in very late waves.

**Conclusion:** The implemented changes have successfully addressed the difficulty spike. The game now provides a fairer, more consistent challenge for new players.
